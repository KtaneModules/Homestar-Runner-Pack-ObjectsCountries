**Note: Project is in development.**

5 modules:

* Strong Mad Talker: **Finished**
  * Note to self: Credit boiaaang for color design
* Main Page: **In Progress**
  * 14/27 main pages implemented, solving process still not fleshed out
  * Could be a cipher, could be a boss module
* Sbemail Songs: **Not Started**
  * Only a vague idea of what to do for the module, something with a 4x4 grid of ones and zeros
* Bronco Trolleys (Needy): **Finished**
* Sid Hoffrenchman (Needy): **Finished**

All have TP support except for Bronco Trolleys. None have ruleseed support, so feel free to help out with that.
