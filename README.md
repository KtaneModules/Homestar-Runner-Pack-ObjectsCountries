# The Homestar Runner Pack

by meeee ::3 (ObjectsCountries)

**Note: Project is in development.**

5 modules:

* Strong Mad Talker: **Finished**
  * Note to self: Credit boiaaang for color design
* Main Page: **In Progress**
  * 15/27 main pages implemented
* Sbemail Songs: **Not Started**
  * Only a vague idea of what to do for the module, next step is to figure out what to do with a 4x4 grid of ones and zeros
  * Currently getting help from a few folk in the HSR community for getting all the audio files and transcriptions
* Bronco Trolleys (Needy): **Finished**
* Sid Hoffrenchman (Needy): **Finished**

All have TP support except for Bronco Trolleys (and technically Sbemail Songs since I haven't started making that one yet). None have ruleseed support, so feel free to help out with that.
