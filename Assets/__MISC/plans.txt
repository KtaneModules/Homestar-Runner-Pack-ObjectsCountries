Sbemail Songs:
design:
- background is tandy/compy/lappy/corpy/compe/lappier
- interface says ">song 1 >song 2 >song 3 >song 4 >submit"
- when ">submit" pressed, numpad appears
manual:
- take 4 numbers, convert to 32-bit binary string (include leading zeros if less than 128)
- tandy: xor
- compy: or
- lappy: and
- corpy: xnor
- compe: nor
- lappier: nand
- perform on bits next to each other
- should now have 16 bits
- create 4x4 grid, bits in reading order

old plan:
- have grid of coordinates with numbers and "X"s in them
- 4 sbemail songs randomly selected
- corresponding numbers form quadrilateral in grid (make line/triangle/triangle with point inside impossible)
- take area of quadrilateral and average of numbers and convert to binary
- bg determines operation (and/or/xor/etc) modulo 206
- submit resulting number when last 2 digits of timer are a multiple of no. of "X"s modulo 10 + 2
