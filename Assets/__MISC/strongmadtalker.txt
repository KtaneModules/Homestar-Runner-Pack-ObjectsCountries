Note: WORD is short for the possibility of any of the following:
the one-syllable word
this word
the word in an absolute position (top left, top right, etc.)
the word in a certain direction relative to this word (to the left, above, etc.)
word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 in the one-syllable word's checking sequence

WORD* means a word guaranteed to be in a different position than WORD (e.g. "word 1" and "word 4" or "the word above this word" and "the word below this word")

Conditions:

Any type of edgework condition
WORD is (orthogonally/diagonally/either) adjacent to WORD* (looping around/not looping around) (Note: cannot use "absolute position")
The module (contains/does not contain) (a word/any of a group of words/all of a group of words)
The serial number shares any letters with WORD
WORD is (longer than/shorter than/the same length as) WORD*
WORD has (already/not yet) been checked (Note: cannot use "the one-syllable word" or "this word")
WORD (is/is not) the decoy regardless of conditions (Note: cannot use "the one-syllable word") (as seen with GARBLEDINA)
WORD is in the (left column/right column/upper half/lower half) of this table
(WORD/any word on the module) is (at least/exactly/under) (number) words long
WORD is word (up to three numbers) in the one-syllable word's checking sequence
WORD is in the (left column/right column/top row/middle row/bottom row) of the module

Ruleseed-exclusive:
WORD comes (before/after) WORD* in alphabetical order

Declarations:

WORD is the decoy
The word in position [(the sum of the serial number's digits/the number of a certain type of edgework) modulo 6] + 1 of the one-syllable word's checking order is the decoy
The word checked by the condition is the decoy (Note: only when the condition checks one word)
The last word checked is the decoy. If this is the first word to be checked and the condition applies, this word is the decoy.

Ruleseed-exclusive:
The first word in (Reading Order/Geometric Order/Chinese Reading Order) that has (been checked/not been checked) on the (module/table) is the decoy

Orders:

(Reverse/Normal) (Reading Order/Geometric Order/Chinese Reading Order) On (Module/Table)
(Alphabetical/Reverse Alphabetical) Order
(Increasing/Decreasing) Word Length (randomly rearranged/kept as is); for ties, use (different type of order)
Order of WORD (randomly rearranged/kept as is) (Note: cannot use "this word", WORD must not end up being the same as "this word")
Order determined by the word that declared the decoy (randomly rearranged/kept as is) (Note: it should be impossible for the word that has this condition to declare itself the decoy)
