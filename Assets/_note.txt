Note: Some assets are shared among the modules.
For example, the font used for the score in Bronco Trolleys is shared with Strong Mad Talker, and is at _Strong Mad Talker/FONT_smt_words.ttf and _Strong Mad Talker/FONT_smt_words.mat.
The texture used as a placeholder for the blink texture for Main Page Homestars that don't blink is the same 1x1 transparent pixel used for empty slots in Sid Hoffrenchman, and is as _Sid Hoffrenchman/characters/transparent.png.
